.Sh NAME
.Nm thermal
.Nd Intel CPU thermal monitoring driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device thermal"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides thermal monitoring for Intel CPUs by reading temperature data from the CPU's on-die thermal sensors.
.Pp
This driver enhances the existing thermal monitoring capabilities by providing per-core temperature readings and a user-friendly interface for accessing thermal data.
.Sh INTERFACE
The
.Nm
driver exposes the following sysctls for each CPU core:
.Pp
.Nm .Va hw.thermal.core0
- Temperature of core 0 in degrees Celsius.
.Pp
.Nm .Va hw.thermal.core1
- Temperature of core 1 in degrees Celsius.
.Pp
... and so on for each additional core.
.Pp
The driver also provides a read interface to retrieve the temperature data for all cores:
.Pp
Read from the thermal device to get the current temperatures of all cores in the format:
.Dl "Core 0: <temperature>"
.Dl "Core 1: <temperature>"
.Pp
Where <temperature> is the current temperature of the core in degrees Celsius.
